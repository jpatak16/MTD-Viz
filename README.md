In November of both 2023 and 2024, the Arizona State University Law School hosted an NBA Mock Trade Deadline Competition to provide participating students from around the country the opportunity to simulate working in an NBA front office just before the NBA trade deadline and receive feedback from real NBA executives as judges, as well as valuable networking opportunities. I got involved with the organizers of the event and volunteered my time and skills. I took on the responsibility of constructing the technology that participants and judges would rely on throughout the weekend.
